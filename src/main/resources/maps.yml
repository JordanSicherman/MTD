# Welcome to the maps file for Minecraft Tower Defense.
# To make a map, simply follow the following instructions.

# Map Template - Spacing is important! #
#<NAME>:
#  game_world: <WORLD_NAME>
#  lobby_spawnpoint: x,y,z
#  mobs_spawnpoint: x,y,z
#  finishline:
#    p1: x,y,z
#    p2: x,y,z
#  towers:
#  - x,y,z
#  - x,y,z
#  - x,y,z
#  signs:

# Copy and paste the template as needed.
# The following is an example game.

MTD:
  game_world: mtd
  lobby_spawnpoint: 0,4,0
  mobs_spawnpoint: 10,4,10
  finishline:
    p1: 10,4,0
    p2: 20,4,0
  towers:
  - 22,10,0
  - 8,10,0
  signs:
  
# Now let's examine it.

# MTD - The name of the map (case-sensitive!). Please don't specify multiple maps with the same name or you'll have troubles.
#
# game_world: The world in which the game will be played. Uses this world in the locations of the lobby, etc.
#             If the world doesn't exist at startup, it will be created. If you're using BungeeCord, it will be created but not used.
# lobby_spawnpoint: The location players will spawn upon joining the map. This one is in the World 'mtd' at 0, 4, 0
#
# mobs_spawnpoint: The location the mobs will spawn once the map starts. Also where the archers spawn when building starts.
#                  This one is in the World 'mtd' at 10, 4, 10
# finishline: p1 and p2 are two separate points that make up the finish line to the tower defense. **Their Y-coordinate must be the same**!
#             They must also share either the X or Z coordinate. In this example, the player must cross the Z-coordinate of 0 between the
#             X-coordinate of 10 and 20.
# towers: Locations where archers will spawn into after building. If you specify less towers then there are archers, they will loop through
#         And add more in order. eg. If there were 5 archers in this map, three would be on the tower at 22, 10, 0 and two would be at 8, 10, 0
# signs: Either leave this entry blank or specify the location of signs you wish to track the game in the same format as the towers.
#        Signs update every second and can be easily added or removed by:
#        A) Placing a sign like so:
#               [MTD]
#               <MAP>
#           Where <MAP> is the name of the map to track.
#        B) Breaking a sign to remove it.
#
# As long as you have proper spacing, everything should work perfectly. Note that underscores must be used in map names - not spaces!
#
# It is important to note that games cannot be played in the main world (The one specified in bukkit.yml) as they cannot be rolled back!
# If you run a game on your main world, DO NOT EXPECT ROLLBACK.
